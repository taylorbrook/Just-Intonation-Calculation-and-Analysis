# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-02)

**Core value:** I can design any JI scale (arbitrary ratios, no prime-limit ceiling), see it expressed as ratios and cents-from-12tet, hear it, and export it to Scala `.scl`/`.kbm` — all from a self-hosted notebook where the calculator and the research prose live together.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — bootstrap-build

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (bootstrap-build) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 4
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4-phase structure follows research-recommended dependency order (bootstrap → kernel-MVP with composition anchor → viz + mobile → analysis); temperament browser deferred to v2
- [Phase ?]: Honored D-17: @observablehq/framework exact-pinned to 1.13.4 (no caret); transitive deps locked via package-lock.json
- [Phase ?]: Honored D-13: package.json contains the 9-script set verbatim (dev, build, lint:types, test, test:watch, lint, format, format:check, ci); no observable deploy script per D-05
- [Phase ?]: Honored D-18: Node 20 LTS pin via .nvmrc (=20) and engines.node (>=20)
- [Phase 01]: Honored D-16: tsconfig.json has all four strict flags (strict, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noImplicitOverride, exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
- [Phase 01]: Honored D-12: ESLint 9 flat config uses recommendedTypeChecked baseline scoped to src/**/*.{ts,js}; root-level configs linted without type-aware rules
- [Phase 01]: Honored D-07: tests live at src/lib/__tests__/ adjacent to source; vitest.config.ts excludes Framework cache and Markdown
- [Phase 01]: Added src/.observablehq/** to ESLint ignores - Framework cache lives at src/.observablehq/, not repo root
